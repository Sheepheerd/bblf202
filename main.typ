= Abstract
= Introduction
Computer engineers at Wright State are deprived of extracurricular opportunities to engage in hands-on robotics projects. Many projects are put on for the computer science students for them to prioritize software development. Projects such as the *ACM Coding Competition* and *Alumni Associations Hackathon* are two of the main projects that promote this idea. Currently, the *Piano Staircase* project has sparked some attention. It allows students to get invovled with microcontrollers and Time-of-Flight sensors. Wright State University has been trying this same idea for the last decade. I propose a new project that would be novel while providing a strong understanding of robotics.

= Objectives
The scope of this project is around developmet of a line-following robot. The robot will be designed to follow a line on the ground using sensors and motors. The project will be divided into several phases, including design, construction, programming, and testing. The main objectives of the project are as follows:

= Project Design / Methodology

== Hardware Design
Students will be provided with a list of materials they are allowed to choose from. There will be multiple nights at the beginning of the semester where current robotics developers will give *Robo-Nights*. These nights are designed for students to ask questions on concepts as well as the design they are wanting to build.   

== Software and Control
The microcontrollers of the robot will be programmed by the students. There will also be classes 

== Learning Modules

== Evaluation Plan
